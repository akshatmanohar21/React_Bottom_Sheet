# React Bottom Sheet

This is a small React app showing a custom bottom sheet component with snap points and smooth transitions. No fancy animation libraries used here.

## Features

- Has three snap points: closed, half-open, and fully open
- Smooth transition using CSS easing (kinda spring-like)
- Supports drag and release to snap
- Includes buttons to move the sheet to different positions
- Responsive for desktop and mobile
- Dark theme with good contrast for the sheet
